# Hi there üëã

I'm Musadiq Peerzada! I'm a curious developer with a knack for understanding how things work. I work full-time at Refyne, focusing on backend development and exploring new technologies. On the side, I enjoy creating tools to enhance workflows and boost productivity.

I believe that sharing knowledge and experiences is incredibly valuable. I write blogs on tech topics, aiming to help others and solidify my own understanding.
